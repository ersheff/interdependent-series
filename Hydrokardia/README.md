# Hydrokardia

*Hydrokardia* is a composition for two laptop performers. The performers directly actuate (via touchscreen) a low-frequency string model that resembles waves when set into motion. The position of discrete points on the wave (the individual masses that comprise the string) are used to excite groups of resonators. Vibrations in the higher-level wave model generate musical events as they propagate through the structure. Visuals are generated live and projected for audience viewing, which enhances perception of the model's behavior.

As a telematic performance, control of the wave is split between the two remote performers. Low-fidelity control data generated by each performer's interactions with their half of the wave is transmitted over the Internet to actuate the corresponding half of the remote wave.

*Hydrokardia* is a collaboration with visual artist [Anna Weisling](http://www.aweisling.com), who designed and constructed the visualization software.
