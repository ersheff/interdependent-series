## Hydrokardia Performance Instructions

*Hydrokardia* uses a text and graphic score. It is read from top to bottom.

The left-most time column is a general guide for progressing though the composition. A timer is provided in the performance patch.

The **A** and **B** columns are the preset changes for players A and B, respectively. Presets are advanced using the < and > keys.

Text and graphics indictate general guidelines for fader movements on the tablet. Moving these faders will actuate the wave model. The fader positions will update in correspondence with the motions of the wave, providing local visual feedback.

Performers should focus more on shaping the general behavior of the wave when interpreting the text and graphic insructions rather than specific fader movements.
