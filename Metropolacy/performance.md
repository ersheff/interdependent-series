## Metropolacy Performance Instructions

### **Snare Notation**
Snare drum notation generally follows standard percussion notation practice. Text instructions are supplied as needed.
"Add 2nd head" (right before rehearsal **B**) means to place the spare drum head on top of the drum and continue playing normally ([see demonstration](https://youtu.be/qDQ7eHNufNs?t=53)). This will lower the pitch of the drum and slightly reduce the resonance. A note to remove the head occurs right before rehearsal **C**.
"Pulse snares w/ feedback" means to emulate the notated rhythm by manually lifting the snares against the head without fully engaging the strainer. The feedback produced by the laptop performer in this section will cause the snares to vibrate.

### **Laptop Notation**
Laptop notation is a combination of standard percussion notation practice and tablature.
The top staff indicates rhythms to be played on the piezo-based interface with the mallet.
The bottom staff includes all MIDI controller actions and is designed to emulate guitar tablature.
The lowest line corresponds to the left-most column of the MIDI controller grid, second lowest to the second column from left, etc.
Numbers on each line indicate which pad to engage in that column for virtual string pitch changes, starting from 1 at the bottom. Pads only need to be pressed once to change the pitch.
**P** and **S** symbols indicate when to turn piezo and snare mics on or off for the respective string. This is done using the two control buttons at the top of each column â€“ the top-most button corresponds to the piezo input, the one right below it corresponds to the snare input.
Paranthetical numbers are simply reminders for which pads should be engaged in that measure.
Lines above the tablature staff indicate feedback, which is accomplished by applying pressure to the MIDI pads. The amount of pressure is mapped to the gain for the signal going to the speaker under the snare drum, so feedback can be controlled by regulating pressure as needed.
There are no specific notations for "crunch," but the slider on the Push is mapped to a value that controls the non-linearity of the virtual strings. This is intentionally used towards the end of the composition (indicated via text instructions) and should also be used judiciouly during feedback sections to add some timbral complexity and help regulate the feedback.
