# Metropolacy

*Metropolacy* is a composition for two performers: one playing an acoustic snare drum, the other playing a laptop-based setup using a MIDI controller and piezo-based interface. The performers collectively control a physical-virtual hybrid instrument comprised of the snare drum and a four-string physics-based model. Both performers have the ability to excite the resonator component of each other's portion of the instrument. Feedback loops can also be created between the two portions of the instrument.

Fabrication instructions for the interfaces can be found [here](fabrication.md).

Software and hardware setup instructions can be found [here](setup.md).

Performance instructions can be found [here](performance.md).

Video recording of a live *Metropolacy* performance can be found here (COMING SOON).
