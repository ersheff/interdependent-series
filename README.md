# Interdependent Series
A trio of compositions featuring interdependent collaborative performance with physics-based virtual instruments.

-   *Resuscitation* – laptop quartet
-   *Metropolacy* – duet for snare drum and laptop
-   *Hydrokardia* – telematic laptop duet

To download these compositions, including scores and all supplemental content, simply use the "Download ZIP" option in the "Clone or Download" menu.

Or, if you are familiar with git, you can clone into a local repository by entering the following in Terminal:\
``git clone https://github.com/ersheff/interdependent-series.git``

If you would like to download the server files for *Hydrokardia*, you will then also need to pull submodules with:\
``git submodule update --init --recursive``\
This step is not necessary to perform *Hydrokardia* but is an option if you would like to examine the server file content.

Setup and performance instructions are provided in the respective folders.
